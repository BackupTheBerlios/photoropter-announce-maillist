Message-ID: <20100214180534.1443e54d@vulcan.local>

Hi everyone,

I am pleased to announce the availability of the first public
release of Photoropter, dubbed 0.0.3.

This initial release still lacks a few things (not least of all
documentation), but is already in a state where it can be used.
Be aware, however, that the current programming interface is
still subject to change.

Regards,
Robert

Subject: [Photoropter-announce] Photoropter 0.0.4
Message-ID: <20100217223351.3734b47e@vulcan.local>

Hi everyone,

Photoropter 0.0.4 is released. You can find it here:

http://prdownload.berlios.de/photoropter/phtr-0.0.4.tar.bz2

Most of the changes are 'under the hood', but there are a few
incompatible changes, too. Most notably the interpolation
classes are now distinct and no longer selected via a template
parameter. What's new:

 * Fixed some bugs in EMOR handling code.
 * Fixed a clipping bug in gamma handling code.
 * Oversampling is runtime-configurable now.
 * Some small changes to signatures, inserted some explicit
   casts (mainly to make VC++ happy).
 * Removed interpolation type as template parameter (historical
   remnant) and created different interpolation class templates.
 * Fixed some historical errors in the documentation.
 * Tutorial updated.

Subject: [Photoropter-announce] Photoropter 0.0.5
Message-ID: <20100221161546.19f89ac6@vulcan.local>

Hi everyone,

I have just released Photoropter version 0.0.5. Lots of
refactoring on the inside, but only small changes to the
'public' API. However, 0.0.5 features quite some noticeable
enhancements. Source archives in different formats can be found
on the download page:

http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11258

The most important changes in Photoropter 0.0.5 are:

* Refactoring to make image transformation more agnostic of
  pixel format (preparation for alpha-channel handling). The
  results of this are not immediately visible on the outside,
  but it improved the code quality significantly I think.
* The documentation now contains only 'public' parts of API by
  default.
* Lanczos interpolation support is working correctly (and
  reasonably fast). The speed penalty of Lanczos-2 compared to
  bilinear interpolation is about 75% (125% for Lanczos-3). The
  results show noticeably better retention of fine details, so
  it is not a bad tradeoff.
* RGBA support. The library can now fully deal with alpha
  channel data; alpha information will be subject to all
  geometric transformations (and ignored in colour
  transformations).
* The PTLens model can now use different parameters on separate
  channels; this should enable fulla-style TCA correction
  (untested as yet).
