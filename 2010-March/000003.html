<PRE>Hello everyone,

I just released version 0.0.6 of Photoropter. Like in the 0.0.5
release, most of the changes happened inside the library, while
the API stayed more or less stable.

Apart from many small bug fixes (including Visual Studio fixes)
and a successful compilation test on Win64, the most notable
changes are:

* Rewrite of phtrtest: now allows to access a greater subset of
  Photoropter's functions (including runtime selection of
  interpolation type and oversampling); also much cleaner code
  structure.
* Command line syntax approximating the one of fulla: -r, -g,
  -b, -c and -x are the same now (so phtrtest can now replicate
  fulla's results in many cases).
* PTLens TCA correction ('fulla-style') fully working and
  producing results identical to fulla.
* Linear scaler model implemented: can be used both for image
  scaling and for simple linear TCA correction (i.e., the same
  model lensfun supports).

Note: since I had to compare their results anyway, I took a look
at transformation times of lensfun's tmod as well. Applying
linear TCA, PTLens distortion correction and global linear
scaling to a 12 megapixel image takes about 10 seconds using
phtrtest on a single CPU (Lanczos-2 interpolation, no
oversampling). tmod takes roughly the same amount of time. Since
lensfun's implementation is very speed-conscientious (to a point
even where I personally regard its style as much 'too C'),
that's very good news, I think.

However, everything lensfun does is (at least to my knowledge)
currently strictly single-threaded. Using both cores of my
machine, phtrtest finishes the task in about 5 seconds (20 when
2x oversampling is active).

Regards,
Robert
